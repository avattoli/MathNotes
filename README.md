# MathNotes

MathNotes is an iOS app for handwritten math noteâ€‘taking with an AI assistant. Users can create folders and files, write using a drawing canvas, and leverage handwriting recognition to convert sketches into text.

## Features
- Organize notes in folders and files
- Drawing canvas for stylus or finger input
- Handwriting recognition service to convert written math to text

## Getting Started
1. Open `MathNotes.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or later.
2. Select an iOS 17 or later simulator or device.
3. Build and run the **MathNotes** scheme.

## Tests
Run the test suite with:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project MathNotes.xcodeproj -scheme MathNotes
```

The tests use the new `Testing` framework, so a recent Xcode toolchain is required.
